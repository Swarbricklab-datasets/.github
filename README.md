# Swarbrick Lab Datasets

This GitHub organisation is still under construction.

The motivation of this organisation is to host *dataset* repos for Swarbrick Lab projects.

Dataset repos are intended to facilitate the sharing and version management of raw and processed data for publications by the Swarbrick Lab.

We are just getting started with this approach, and there will inevitably be teething problems, so please bear with us.

Please report any problems via the "Issues" for the relevant repo.
